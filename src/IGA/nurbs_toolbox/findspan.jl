    findspan(n::I,p::I,u::F,U::Vector{F})::I where {I<:Integer,F<:AbstractFloat}

Find the span of a B-Spline knot vector at a parametric point

# Arguments:
- `n`: nuber of control points `-1`
- `p`: spline degree
- `n`: parametric point
- `U`: knot sequence

# Output:
- `s`: knot span of `u` in `U`

# Examples:
```julia-repl
julia> s = findspan(n,p,u,U)
```

# Reference:
- Algorithm A2.1 from 'The NURBS BOOK' pg68 ([1997Piegl](@cite))
